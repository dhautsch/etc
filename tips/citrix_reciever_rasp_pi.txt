#  SSL error
#  Contact your help desk with the following information:
#  You have not chosen to trust "COMODO RSA Certification
#  Authority", the issuer of the server's security certificate
#  (SSL error 61)

To fix I downloaded
        comodorsaaddtrustca.crt
From
        https://support.comodo.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/966/108/intermediate-1-sha-2-comodo-rsa-certification-authority
And
        comodorsacertificationauthority.crt
From
        https://support.comodo.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/969/108/root-comodo-rsa-certification-authority-sha-2
Then copy these two files to
        /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore
