# AES encryption on Sun Solaris
#
# Following are steps to:
# 1) create 128 AES key file
# 2) encrypt clear.txt to crypt.txt
# 3) decrypt crypt.txt
#
# Note the key file is read only and it does not appear to work with setfacl to make it readable by others

Manipulating Variables (ksh/bash only) http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Erc/classes/ksh/variable-manipulation.html
Text variables
The pattern in the following uses the same wildcards as for filename matching.

${#var}
    returns the length of $var in characters 
${var%pattern}
    removes the shortest suffix of $var patching pattern 
${var%%pattern}
    removes the longest suffix of $var patching pattern 
${var#pattern}
    removes the shortest prefix of $var patching pattern 
${var##pattern}
    removes the longest prefix of $var patching pattern 

Numeric variables

$(( integer expression ))
    The $(( ... )) construction interprets the contents as an arithmetic expression (integer only). Variables are referenced by name without the "$". Most of the arithmetic syntax of the 'C' language is supported, including bit manipulations (*,/,+,-,|,&,<<,>>. Use parentheses for changing precedence). 

Examples
datapath=/data/public/project/trials/set1/datafile.dat

filename=${datapath##*/}
    filename is set to "datafile.dat" since the longest prefix pattern matching "*/" is the leading directory path (compare basename) 
path=${datapath%/*}
    path is set to "/data/public/project/trials/set1" since the shortest suffix pattern matching "/*" is the filename in the last directory (compare dirname)

i=$((i+1))
    often used in while loops
